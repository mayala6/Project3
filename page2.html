		Occupation

		<p>
		I am currently a police officer for Chicago Police Department. My assignment is in the 19th district which is the Wrigleyville neighborhood. 
		I'm currenlty on bike patrol, which is great because it keeps me in great shape. Although I sweat a lot I feel it's rewarding. The scenery 
		is awesome, our skyline is beautiful and I see it everyday. I also see a lot of boats and Belmont Harbor, Montrose Harbor and Diversey Harbor. 
		Another reason I like my assigment is the lunch options are great, the food options are endless and there are no bad restaurants.
